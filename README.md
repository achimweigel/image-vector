# Image Vector

This repo describes the image vectors that are used by [Gardener](https://github.com/gardener/gardener) and other components to describe oci images that are deployed during their runtime.

In particular the interaction (image-vector -> ComponentDescriptor -> image-vector) with the CNUDIE Component descriptor is described.

See the [image vector documentation](./docs/imagevector.md) for detailed documentation about the image vector and its usage in general. <br>
See the [image vector - Component Descriptor documentation](./docs/imagevector_cd.md) for detailed documentation about the interaction between image vectors and component descriptors.
